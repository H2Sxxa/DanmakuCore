DanmakuCore is a mod to help make danmaku stuff without setting up all the tedious stuff like the Danmaku Entity, spellcards, rendering, and so on. Everything here comes prepackaged in an easy to use form. Just plug in in, and start using it.

## Features
* Danmaku Entity
* Spellcards
* Danmaku living entities
* Danmaku boss entity
* Easy to extend
* Minimal use of number ids
* Small set of defaults as examples, and to provide what everyone will want to create anyway.

DanmakuCore is currently still in development. Once it's in a state where I feel that I can release it I will. If you still want to use it, compile it yourself.
